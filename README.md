Types of algorithms-----


1.searching algorithms and these pop up in cases where you need to find a specific piece of data inside a larger data structure. For example, searching for a substring inside of a larger string, or maybe finding a file within a set of nested folders on a file system. 


2.Sorting algorithms are another very common type used when working with ordered sets of data. And, as you might have guessed, they take a set of data, and place it into a particular order. 


3.Computational algorithms are used to take one set of data and derive another set of data from it. And a simple example might be calculating whether a given number is a prime number or maybe computing a temperature in one scale when you already have it in another scale. 


4.And finally, there are collection algorithms, which involve manipulating or navigating among sets of data that are stored within a particular structure. And again, it's not hard to imagine some examples here, counting specific items, filtering out unwanted data, and so on
